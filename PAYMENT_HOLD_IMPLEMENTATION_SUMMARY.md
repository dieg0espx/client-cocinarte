# Stripe Payment Hold Implementation - Complete Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Your Cocinarte booking system now uses Stripe's **Authorization and Capture** payment flow. Payments are held when bookings are made and only charged if the class is fully booked 12 hours before it starts.

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### 1. Payment Flow
**Before:** Payment charged immediately at booking time
**After:** Payment authorized (held) at booking, captured or canceled 12 hours before class

### 2. Customer Experience
- **At Booking:** Card is authorized, funds are held (shows as pending on card)
- **12 Hours Before Class:**
  - ✅ **Class is full** → Payment captured (charged)
  - 🚫 **Class not full** → Authorization canceled (hold released, NOT charged)

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

Run the SQL migration in your Supabase SQL editor:

```bash
# File: scripts/update-bookings-for-payment-hold.sql
```

This adds:
- `stripe_payment_intent_id` column (VARCHAR(255))
- Updates `payment_status` constraint to allow 'held' and 'canceled'

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables

Ensure your `.env.local` has:

```env
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_key

# Stripe
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

# Timezone
TIMEZONE=America/Los_Angeles
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Dependencies already exist (stripe, node-cron, dotenv)

### Step 4: Test the Booking Flow

```bash
# Start your Next.js app
npm run dev

# Make a test booking through the UI
# Check Stripe Dashboard to see the held payment
```

### Step 5: Run the Payment Capture Cron Job

```bash
# In a separate terminal
npm run cron:payment-capture
```

## 🔍 Testing

### Test Cards (Stripe Test Mode):

**Success:**
- 4242 4242 4242 4242 (Visa)
- Any future expiry date
- Any 3-digit CVC

**Declined:**
- 4000 0000 0000 0002 (Card declined)
- 4000 0000 0000 9995 (Insufficient funds)

### Test Scenarios:

1. **Fully Booked Class:**
   - Create a class with maxStudents: 2
   - Book 2 spots with test cards
   - Wait for cron job (or manually trigger)
   - Verify payments are captured in Stripe Dashboard

2. **Not Fully Booked:**
   - Create a class with maxStudents: 5
   - Book 2 spots
   - Wait 12 hours (or modify cron to check sooner)
   - Verify authorizations are canceled

## 📊 Monitoring

### Stripe Dashboard
View payments at: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments

**Payment States:**
- **Requires Capture** - Authorized (held) payments
- **Succeeded** - Captured (charged) payments
- **Canceled** - Canceled authorizations

### Cron Job Logs

```bash
npm run cron:payment-capture
```

Shows:
- Classes found for processing
- Enrollment status (fully booked or not)
- Payment capture/cancel results
- Summary of operations

---

## ⏰ Cron Job Schedule

**Current Schedule:** Every hour (checks for classes 12 hours away)

**To Change:**
Edit `cron/payment-capture-handler.js` line ~262:

```javascript
// Every hour (current)
cron.schedule('0 * * * *', ...)

// Every 30 minutes
cron.schedule('*/30 * * * *', ...)

// Every 6 hours
cron.schedule('0 */6 * * *', ...)
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### 1. Authorization Expiry
- Stripe authorizations expire after **7 days**
- Classes must occur within 7 days of booking
- Or run capture cron job before 7 days

### 2. Customer Communication
Consider adding:
- ✉️ Email when payment is captured
- ✉️ Email when authorization is canceled (with explanation)
- ✉️ Booking confirmation mentions payment is held

### 3. Production Deployment

**Option A: PM2 (Recommended)**
```bash
pm2 start cron/payment-capture-handler.js --name payment-capture
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

**Option B: Docker**
```dockerfile
FROM node:18
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["node", "cron/payment-capture-handler.js"]
```

**Option C: Cloud Functions**
- AWS Lambda with EventBridge
- Google Cloud Functions with Cloud Scheduler
- Vercel Cron Jobs (requires Pro plan)
